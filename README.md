# Fried Chips
The Baked Beans fork for High Performance Blockchain

In true degen style, the Baked Beans mining contract has been forked for High Performance Blockchain!

The key differences between Fried Chips and Baked Beans are as follows:

Baked Beans Dev fee was 3$
Fried Chips Dev fee is only 2% (far more sustainable!)

Baked Beans paid out 12% commission on referrals (crazy!)
Fried Chips pays out a more conservative 5% commission on referrals

To understand why this is important, view CTRLZ's YouTube video on Baked Beans and why the sustainability projections were low.
Remember, someone has to pay the commission fees, and it's normally the people last in, who have to pay those in early.
With a more conservative 5% commission, the project will be sustainable for at least 1-2 years.

How does it work?

Simple..... deposit HPB and get Chips.

You can then either Fry your chips (compound your investment) or Eat your Chips (take out your HPB interest)

Important to note, just like Baked Beans, you cannot withdraw your initital deposit, only the interest earned.

Strategy....the most common strategy is to Fry your chips once a day, for 6 days, and then on the 7th day, eat your chips!

This allows the HPB in the contract to grow, and ensures your interest earned (up to 8% per day!) stays high.

If you continue to eat your chips without frying them, your daily % will diminish.
